_**[Natural language processing Firm 10-Ks to identify risks and their impact](analysis_report)**_

This analysis report uses textual analysis on 10-Ks to identify public firm exposures to several risk factors. I then identified the correlation between these risk factors and the firms respective returns on the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
